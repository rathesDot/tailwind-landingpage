# Landingpage made with Tailwind CSS

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

Some days ago, out of mood, I started creating this little landing-page using Tailwind CSS. As I'm not interested in using it anymore, I want to give it to the crowd.

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack:

```
yarn watch
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.

## Contributing

If you want to use this for your projects, just fork this and customize it as much as you need. If you think that there should be some general improvements (I know of some already) feel free to send me an PR!

Otherwise, happy coding!
